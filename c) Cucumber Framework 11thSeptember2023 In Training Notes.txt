11/9/2023 - Cucumber Framework - 

1) Cucumber -> software tool used by the testers to develop test cases for the testing behaviour of the software.

2) In Cucumber, the test cases are written in simple English which anybody can understand without technical expertise. (eg. business analyst, project manager)

3) The simple English text is called the GHERKIN language.

4) What is Gherkin ? 

a) business readable language which helps to describe wihtout going into the implementation details. it is used in feature file.

b) It is line - oriented language.

c) start with a keyword & ends with a stop.

d) It is a feature like thing which always starts with a keyword & ends with a stop.

5) The Cucumber Framework: BDD Framework for Selenium

Cucumber BDD framework mainly consists of three major parts â€“ 
a) Feature File, 
b) Step Definitions, and the 
c) Test Runner File.

a) Feature File -> A standalone unit or a single functionality (like login) for a project.
EAch of this feature will have separate scenario which is to be tested using selenium integrated with cucumber. A file that stores data about features, their descriptions & scenarios

Cucumber tests are written within these feature files that are stored with the extension .feature.

A feature file can be given a description to make the documentation more legible.

**Keywords such as Given, When & Then used to test in Cucumber are called Annotations.

*Difference between feature & scenario is -> Feature is high level in depth feature. 

*Multiple scenarios can be stored in a single feature.

*Each when is considered as a single step.

*Then - Expected output.

*BackGround - helps you to add some context to the scenario. 

GIVEN - Precondition of a particular test.
WHEN - 
THEN - 
AND & BUT - combine mulitple into 

2) Step Definitions -
*Its a JAVA file.
*Stores the mapping data between each step of a scenario between feature file & code to be executed.
*Used to map feature file to the code, It can use both Java & Selenium commands.

3) TEST RUNNER FILE -
