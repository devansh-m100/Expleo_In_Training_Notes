11/9/2023 - Cucumber Framework - 

1) Cucumber -> software tool used by the testers to develop test cases for the testing behaviour of the software.

2) In Cucumber, the test cases are written in simple English which anybody can understand without technical expertise. (eg. business analyst, project manager)

3) The simple English text is called the GHERKIN language.

4) What is Gherkin ? 

a) business readable language which helps to describe wihtout going into the implementation details. it is used in feature file.

b) It is line - oriented language.

c) start with a keyword & ends with a stop.

d) It is a feature like thing which always starts with a keyword & ends with a stop.

5) The Cucumber Framework: BDD Framework for Selenium

Cucumber BDD framework mainly consists of three major parts â€“ 
a) Feature File, 
b) Step Definitions, and the 
c) Test Runner File.

a) Feature File -> A standalone unit or a single functionality (like login) for a project.
EAch of this feature will have separate scenario which is to be tested using selenium integrated with cucumber. A file that stores data about features, their descriptions & scenarios

Cucumber tests are written within these feature files that are stored with the extension .feature.

A feature file can be given a description to make the documentation more legible.

**Keywords such as Given, When & Then used to test in Cucumber are called Annotations.

*Difference between feature & scenario is -> Feature is high level in depth feature. 

*Multiple scenarios can be stored in a single feature.

*Each when is considered as a single step.

*Then - Expected output.

*BackGround - helps you to add some context to the scenario. 

**Syntax Of Gherkin - 

GIVEN - Precondition of a particular test.
WHEN - [Event or Trigger]
THEN - [Expected Output]
AND & BUT - combine mulitple into 
# - For comment
BACKGROUND - Add some context to the scenario.

2) Step Definitions -

*Its a JAVA file.
*Stores the mapping data between each step of a scenario between feature file & code to be executed.
*Used to map feature file to the code, It can use both Java & Selenium commands.

But we will not execute this Step Definition, we will execute only feature.

3) TEST RUNNER FILE - 

To run the test, one needs a Test Runner File, which is a JUnit Test Runner Class containing the Step Definition location and the other primary metadata required to run the test.

The Test Runner File uses the @RunWith() Annotation from JUnit for executing tests. It also uses the @CucumberOptions Annotation to define the location of feature files, step definitions, reporting integrations, etc.


Features of Cucumber -

1) Cucumber Hooks - Blocks of code that runs before or after each scenario. So we can define anywhere in our project. Eg - Step Definition.

As per the definition, these are just two annotation @After & @Before. In the console, we can see the blocks getting executed and giving clear output. We can also execute the hooks for specific tags.

2) Cucumber Tags - Normally used over the feature file to classify the scenarios over the feature files as per their given tag name.

Tags are user defined and we can given any name to it such as @Smoke, @Regression, etc.
